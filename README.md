# FlossBoss Documentation Repository

## Introduction
The FlossBoss Documentation Repository serves as the central hub for all project documentation, supporting the cohesion and clarity of the entire FlossBoss dental appointment management system. This repository is dedicated to housing all documentation, which includes detailed system overviews, architectural designs, workflow explanations, and information related to each sprint. By centralizing the documentation in a single repository, we ensure that all information is accessible, organized, and up-to-date, reflecting the collaborative effort of the FlossBoss team.

## Wiki page
All documentation within this repository is conveniently located in the [**wiki**](https://git.chalmers.se/courses/dit355/2023/student-teams/dit356-2023-16/flossboss/-/wikis/home), allowing for easy navigation and collaboration. 

## Related repostitories
This documentation complements the two additional repositories: the Java codebase for backend services and the JavaScript codebase for the client/server aspects of the system. While the code repositories focus on the implementation details and house the actual source code, this repository offers a overview of the system, explaining the interrelations and the rationale behind architectural decisions. It provides the context necessary to understand the functionality and structure of the system.
